      <p><span class="highlightred">Game Design II Fantasy Map:</span> This map was an exercise in worldbuilding, and my inspiration was based off of a website that automatically generates island maps, with that being the basis for the continent/island in this image. The location names were 'randomized' from a list of terms like estate, salt flats, caves, and more. The very anglo sounding names led me to creating a ficitonal island country based on the UK and Ireland, with elements of Early 20th century imperialism and nationalism before World War I. The time period I imagined this world in was from 1899-1914, with early mechanization and industrialization alongside booming monopolies that effectively control government. There is lore on each location on the map, with a conflict brewing between the city on the east and the city on the west, in a conflict partially inspired by colonial conflicts from the 20th century. In short, this was a thought exercise of a fictional world that uses real world political inspiration to tell a narrative about industialization, monopoly control over government, and mechanized warfare in the framework of a western RPG where the player is thrust upon the world and can choose to help various factions in their missions that shape the world.</p>

      <p><span class="highlightred">Game Design II Puzzle Design</span> This was part of a puzzle design that was based off the existing framework of a modular puzzle game that can be modified with different rooms. I called each one a different, fitting name that represented the way through to the end of the Puzzle. The first one, "Dont Look Back," is a simple 'puzzle' that I made first, mostly to just make a level that the player could walk through. The second one called "Miles Per Gallon," is a level that can only be completed with more than 5 points. Since you spend 5 points to move, and you gain points for picking up keys and treasure, the player is gaining "fuel" in order to move, much like how we think about Miles Per Gallon when fueling for a long drive. This one is more of a basis for a larger puzzle that is much more open ended, and could be made into an interesting resource management game that is simple but full of complex decisions. The last one, Sekiro-Like, is much like the game where the name comes from. Sekiro is a soulsborne game that has a mechanic where the player can ressurect themselves when they die, leaving the world as it is around them, but being able to get a second chance. This puzzle is not possible to beat on the first try, but when getting rid of the enemy by dying to it, the path is unblocked, and only the missing tiles from you walking in your past life are in your way to the end.</p>
